    reimagined as Lord Krishna. He features a luminous blue complexion with a
    serene, gentle gaze, his long, wavy dark hair adorned with a vibrant peacock
    feather crown. Prashanth is dressed in exquisitely embroidered traditional
    silk garments and ornate gold jewelry, exuding a divine aura. The background
    is a celestial, lush Vrindavan setting with a shimmering lotus pond and
    soft, ethereal lighting that accentuates every intricate detail. Captured
    with a Canon EOS R5 at 50mm, f/1.8, ISO 100, this cinematic portrait merges
    mythic grandeur with lifelike realism. --ar 16:9 --v 5

    Ultra-high-resolution, hyper-detailed cinematic headshot of Prashanth—a
    20-year-old, 5'3" young professional with smooth, youthful skin and clear,

    Ultra-high-resolution, photorealistic portrait of Prashanth, a 22-year-old,
    5'5" tall young man, realistically reimagined as Iron Man. His face is
    highly detailed, lifelike, and identical to his real-world appearance, with
    well-defined facial features, natural skin texture, and expressive eyes full
    of determination. The iconic red and gold Iron Man armor is highly detailed,
    metallic, and realistic, with subtle battle scratches, polished reflections,
    and intricate technological engravings. The helmet is lifted, revealing
    Prashanth's face seamlessly integrated into the suit.  The setting is a
    high-tech Stark Industries lab, filled with futuristic holographic displays,
    glowing blue arc reactor lights, and a cinematic bokeh background. The image
    is captured in perfect lighting, ensuring natural shadows and reflections
    that enhance depth and realism. The composition is dynamic and professional,
    as if captured with a 50mm f/1.8 lens on a high-end DSLR, with a cinematic,
    ultra-HD finish. Every detail is carefully refined to ensure a flawless,
    true-to-life depiction of Prashanth as Iron Man

    A highly detailed, ultra-realistic portrait of Prashanth, a 22-year-old,
    5'5" tall young warrior, transformed into an ancient Indian soldier from a
    great empire like the Maurya, Gupta, or Rajput dynasties. His face remains
    exactly the same, ensuring perfect resemblance to Prashanth, with lifelike
    skin texture, natural facial expressions, and deep, determined eyes.  He is
    wearing a traditional warrior’s armor, intricately crafted with gold and
    bronze engravings, layered over a deep maroon and royal blue battle tunic.
    His iron shoulder guards and arm bracers reflect the sunlight, showing signs
    of battle wear. A beautifully designed metal chest plate embossed with
    ancient Hindu motifs and war symbols rests over his powerful physique,
    giving him an imposing yet noble presence.  In his right hand, he holds a
    massive curved Indian Talwar (sword), polished and battle-ready, while his
    left hand grips a large, round shield decorated with war insignias and tiger
    engravings. The shield shows scratches, indicating past battles. His long
    hair is tied back, with a warrior’s headband, and his forehead is marked
    with tilak (sacred war paint), a sign of devotion and strength.  The
    backdrop is a majestic battlefield at sunrise, with dust and golden light
    reflecting on his armor. War elephants, fellow warriors, and ancient flags
    waving in the wind give a sense of historical grandeur. His expression is
    calm, focused, and fearless, as he stands ready for battle, a true warrior
    of ancient India.  Rendered in 8K ultra-HD, cinematic realism, lifelike skin
    texture, perfect facial identity preservation, hyper-detailed armor
    reflections, and dynamic battlefield lighting. The image should look as if
    it was photographed in real life, blending historical accuracy and extreme
    realism

    A highly detailed, ultra-realistic portrait of Prashanth, a 22-year-old slim
    and toned man, standing at 5'3" (160 cm) tall and weighing exactly 50 kg. He
    has a lean, athletic body with visible six-pack abs, naturally toned without
    excess muscle bulk. His face is an exact match to the reference image,
    maintaining his same facial features, hairstyle, skin tone, and sharp
    jawline.  Prashanth is shirtless, revealing his defined abs and lean upper
    body, wearing fitted black joggers or athletic shorts. His arms and chest
    are slim but toned, with natural muscle definition, not exaggerated
    bodybuilding proportions. He stands in a relaxed yet confident posture,
    hands casually placed or slightly flexing his abs, in a modern gym setting
    or an outdoor beach during sunset.  The camera captures him from a
    straight-on perspective, ensuring his height appears proportionate (not
    stretched or too tall). The lighting is natural and cinematic, softly
    emphasizing his physique without harsh shadows. The image is photorealistic,
    8K ultra-HD, captured with a high-end DSLR (50mm f/1.2 lens), ensuring
    extreme detail in skin texture, muscle tone, and facial accuracy. The focus
    is on creating a realistic, professional image that looks natural and
    stylish
